# surfs_up

**Overview of the analysis**

The client W. Avy wanted more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wanted temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. So, the aim was to create a query that filtered and calculated the data across the required months

**Results**
1. The mean temperature for the months of June and December have a considerabe difference. While in June the mean temperature is almost 75, it is 71 in December. However, the count needs to be takeninto consideration as the count for June us more than comapred to December

2. The max temperature also differs, albeit marginally. The max temperature for June is 85, while Decembers max temperature is 83.

**Summary**
Comparing the results of the query, it can be seen that the temperature data is not that skewed, which answers the main concern of the client W. Avy. However, in order for him to make a better infomred decision, there are 2 more data that needs to be queried - **percipitation** and analysing the **most active stations**. Percipitation data will have an impact on decison making especially if percipitation differs from the temperature. Where as understanding the active weather stations will help understand locations better suited given the data available. Overall, as per the current analysis, it looks like the temperature is favoriable for W. Avy to set up shop year-round!
